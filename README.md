# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project! 🎯 This project applies **machine learning** to predict house prices based on various features like size, bedrooms, location, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict house prices using **regression models**.
- **Dataset:** [House Prices - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset Information
- `train.csv` → Training data with house features & prices.
- `test.csv` → Test data (without prices).
- `data_description.txt` → Description of all dataset columns.
